- {} curly brackets holds value,data,instruction/defination  it also helps in seeing narrowing 
- () paranthesis holds parameters meaning what values a function will need like (int a) for its instruction to execute
Parameter means for eg
With int a b c as parameter do addition or substraction on these by being within this a b c cant get d which is not in parameter

                    Short Answer: Nothing.
                    Better Answer: return 0 it's used in main like a signal for know the exit of program was a success when return 0 executes.
                    Best Answer: Still nothing because compilers already "put" return 0 in the the end of your code if you not explicit. But still use is a good practice and give better readbility for your code because is a pattern.
