    * Datatypes in C++ *
    ********************

    In Cpp there are 3 types of datatypes
    1- Primary (int, char, bool, float, double, void):
                These are predefined datatypes in the compiler itself and are fixed and cannot be changed (can only be changed in compiler itself by editing the code of compiler)
                if you want to have your own defined datatype use UserDefined data types.

    2- Derived (Function, Array, Pointers, Reference):
                The data-types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types

    3- User Defined (Class, Structure, Union, Enum, Typedef/Using)
