    The standard library (that is part of the language) has been written exclusively in C++. Also the big mayority of libraries are written in C++.
    However C++ implements an easy way to incorporate libraries written in other languages. On this way, there are several libraries written in other languages like C or Fortran, for instance.
    
    basically a library like <algorithm>, <imgui>, etc which provide abstraction and allow programmers to
    achieve complex tasks without typing complex code

    To understand it in a deeper way these liberaries provide an abstrations to the programmer for example <imgui>
    liberary where if your use box::___ you can create a box now in this case you didnt had to write all the code that
    was required to make that box same way in <algorithm> where we type what calculations to perform without writing 
    the algorithm ourselfs.
