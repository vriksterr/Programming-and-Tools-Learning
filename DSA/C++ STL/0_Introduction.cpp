/*
    C++ has an STL (Standard Template Library) it provides libraries for implementation of basic 
    data structures and basic algorithms which are useful from interview standpoint as we dont have
    to implement these basic dsa from scratch

    STL in C++ can be divided into 2 parts 1 is containers and another one is algorithms

    Containers:
        Simple: pair,vector,forward list, forward_list
        Sequence Containers: Array, Vector, Deque, List, forward-list
        Container adapters: Stack, Queue, Priority-queue
        Associative: Set, Map, MultiSet, MultiMap
        Unordered Associative: Unordered-Set. Unordered Map, Unordered MultiSet, Unordered MultiMap

    Algorithms: Binary-search, find, reverser/rotate, Lower/Upped bount, min/max, sort/swap etc
