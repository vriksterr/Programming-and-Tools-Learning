    * Set *
    *******
    
    -Set only stores Unique elements no repetition
    -Once an element has been added you cannot modify that element just ADD or Delete
    -All set functions are of O(log n)
    
    There are 2 types of set 1.Ordered Set- the set will be in ascending order with starting index being smallest and ending being the largest and the elements you fetch are in ordered also it is slower than unordered.
                             2.Unordered Set- the elements your fetch are in random order as you feed in 

    Q-When should we use a SET?
    A-Generally in questions where we are asked to find/store unique elements

    Functions:  .insert()           //Adds element in the set
                .erase(begin,end)
                .find()             //will return an iterator that points to the element inside ()
                .count()            //Tells how many times an element is present in the set mostly used in multiset
                .empty()
                .clear()            //deletes everything
                .size()
                
    Iterators:  .begin()    //starting point of the array the 0th element
                .end()      //empty address after the last element in the array which will be a null character
                .rbegin()   //ending point of the array 
                .rend()     //empty address before the beginning of the array which will be a null charcter
    
     Implementation will not be asked in interview just the name will be asked, SET implements Red Black Tree

    //st.erase(st.begin(),st.begin() +2);  //wont work instead you have to use for loop. Let us assume you have to delete a range( st. begin() , st.begin()+2) . Then take a for loop run it 2 times. Then you will a get a pointer (pt) pointing to st.begin()+2 . Then pass it as st.erase(st.begin(),pt) .

    //Find Function
    auto iterator = st.find(2);     //st.find() will return an iterator that points to 1, works in log n. For multiset will return the first element address

//Printing a SET
    //1st method
