    * Vector *
    **********

    Vector is build upon array but the the speciality it is dynamic that means we can add endless 
    elements without wooring about the size.

    Note each time the vector fills up the size of vector doubles each time we add a new element.

    Also it has the same memory limitations as the array in main and global

    Functions:      .fill(0)                            //fills the entire array with 0
                    .at( )                              //accessing a specific position and getting its value
                    .empty()                            //will  tell if array is empty of not
                    .front() or arr.at(0)               //will give the first element in the array
                    .back()  or arr.at(arr.size()-1)    //will give the end element in the array
                    .size()                             //tells the number of elements in an array

    Iterators(addresses):   .begin()    //starting point of the array the 0th element
                            .end()      //empty address after the last element in the array which will be a null character
                            .rbegin()   //ending point of the array 
                            .rend()     //empty address before the beginning of the array which will be a null charcter
