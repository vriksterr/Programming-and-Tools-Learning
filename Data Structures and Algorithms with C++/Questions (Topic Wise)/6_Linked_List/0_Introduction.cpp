    Node *head = new class Node;       // head second and third will all have individual Value and Next pointer which are declated in heap coz we typed new Node.
    Node *second = new Node();         // this is the prefered way of writing the above is just another way of writing it as well for understanding purpose.
    Node *third = new Node();
    
    auto value_size = sizeof(head->Value);
    auto next_size = sizeof(head->Next);
    auto value_address = &head->Value;

    cout<<"Size of value on heap-> "<< value_size<<endl;
    cout<<"Size of next on heap-> "<< next_size<<endl;

    (*head).Value = 1;      //can be written like this or like below

    second->Next = third;

    third->Value = 3;
    third->Next = NULL;  // or NULL both works
