| Tuples |
|________|
A tuple is created by placing all the items(elements) inside parentheses(), separated by commas. The
parentheses are optional, however, it is a good practice to  use them.

Tuples are immutable. This means that elements of tuple cannot be changed once it has been assigned.

Both Strings and Tuples are immutable, rest eveything else will remain the same as List

For example:

1. my_tuple = ()
2. my_tuple = (1,2,3)
3. my_tuple = (1,"Hello",3.4)
