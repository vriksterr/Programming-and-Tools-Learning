    We use CSS to style the html document without it the website cant look beautiful so it is
    very important.

    We can use styles in html tags directly with style=" " and type the styles there but its
    not going to look clean and will be a mess to deal with on a large website.

    | How to use different selectors in CSS |
    |_______________________________________|
        -In css we can have to target what we are trying to style either via typing its type like

            p{
            }

        -or via typing its class name like

            .login-button{
            }

        -or using id but remember id needs to be unique per css/html page so we cant share tham like we can with
         class so we rather preferr class but a way to use id would be:

            <div id="id1"></div>

            #id1{
            }
            #id2{
            }

        -There is one more way to select everything on the page that need to be styled and that is called everything 
         selector and that is denoted by * like:

            *{
            }

    | Combining Selectors together in CSS |
    |_____________________________________|

        We can use a selector withing a selector and that can be done like: 

            p.classname , span{         //here , is a or that says if its a p.classname or span the style in {} will be used
            }
            
            //or
            
            h1.classname , span{               //we cannot do h1.h2.classname
            }
            
            //or
            
            h1.class2.classname#id3 , span{    //you can have only one element selector h1 and one id selector id3 we cannot do the abome comment and .id1.id2
            }

        This way we can use a selector with another selector to give a bit more confined controll
        on what we wnat to select and how we want to style a specific part/parts of HTML

        Another method of styling for nexted divs and p:

        div.classname p.red{            //this states that parent div with class name classname and its child p or in this case p with class of red should get the css style
        }                               //remember if it was just div p that means p1 p2 only would have receaved the styling and p3 is nested within h1 so for that we had to do a seprate like div p h1

        <div class="classname">
            <p> p1 </p>
            <p class="red"> p2 </p>
            <h1> <p> p3 </p> </h1>
        </div>
