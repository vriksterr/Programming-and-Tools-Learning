    | Specificity in CSS |
    |____________________|

    lets say if we do this
        p{
            color: red;
        }
        p{
            color: ping;
        }
    paragraph will have ping color as the color got over written by the second style

    BUT, CSS has specificity that means in css there are 5 prorities 0 0 0 0 0 which refers to
    inline css/styles, !important, id, class, element(p,h1,div) so based of what is being used
    we will have prority of that specific css style to be implemented

    important > inline css/styles > id > class > element(p,h1,div)
    
    so if there is a higher prority in like 0,0,1,0,0 vs 0,0,0,1000,0 stull the 0,0,1,0,0 will 
    get selected coz it has id and it has higher priority even if there are 1000 class.
